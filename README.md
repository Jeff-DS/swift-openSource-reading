## Welcome

This course will be an introductory online Swift +  iOS course that we will be releasing at the end of August. When this is released at the end of August, it will be using Swift 3 in Xcode 8. No worries though, the lessons available to you now are written using Swift 2.2 in Xcode 7.

Although we title it as an introductory course, this will be challenging.

Here are the units available to you know:

* Introduction
* Basics
* UI
* Arrays
* Optionals
* Tuples

As I'm working on this (on the daily), new material should be released every few days which will become immediately accessible to you. I will notify you via Slack when new material is available.

As you're going through this curriculum, it would be **great** if you could help us improve it and give us feedback.

--- 

**How do I leave feedback**?

You're going to give feedback within Learn and on the individual lessons. If you have a suggestion, question, issue, or problem, click on the icon in Learn that lets you raise an issue.

If your issue or feedback is about multiple lessons, then you can just raise the issue on one of those lessons and reference the other ones (if you could include the titles of the other lessons that would be helpful)

---

**What if I see typos or other things that I can fix myself?** You can also edit the curriculum on Learn. Click on the icon in Learn that lets you do that and you can make the pull request yourself. â€‹

**What kind of feedback should I give?** In short, give us feedback on everything! If you're wondering whether your issue or comment is too small, it's not. Don't worry about hurting our feelings or being too critical. We want to make this curriculum amazing and having everyone's feedback and suggestions on this will only make us better.

Think specifically about whether the content feels good for beginners. Do you feel comfortable but also challenged? Does the pacing work? Should there be more or less content anywhere? What's confusing? What needs to be explained better? Where are you lost? Is everything that you're supposed to be doing in the labs covered in the Readings that come before it? Please try to run and do the labs so that we can find any technical bugs in there as well. 

And is it fun? Are you enjoying the lessons? Do they want you to keep moving forward? 

Also tell us what's working so that we know what we're doing well and what we should be doing more of. That can be as simple as a single sentence or example that we use to describe a concept. 

If you have any questions, please email or slack me at any time!

I'm **BEYOND** excited about this! Good luck on your journey.
